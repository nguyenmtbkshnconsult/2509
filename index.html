                                O’Neill’s 1920 play <em>Beyond the Horizon</em>.
                                Andrew and Robert Mayo are brothers who grew up
                                on their family’s farm.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                ANDREW: Farming ain’t your nature. There’s all
                                the difference
                                shown in just the way us two feel about the
                                farm. You—well, you like the home part of
                                it, I expect; but as a place to work and grow
                                things, you hate it. Ain’t that right?
                                ROBERT: Yes, I suppose it is. For you it’s
                                different. You’re a
                                Mayo through and through. You’re wedded to the
                                soil. You’re as much a product of it as
                                an ear of corn is, or a tree. Father is the
                                same. This farm is his life-work.

                            <p>In the past, historians who wanted to examine
                                Frederick Douglass’s diary and other personal
                                papers had to visit the Library of Congress in
                                Washington, DC, to view them on microfilm
                                (<u>film containing scaled-down reproductions of
                                    documents</u>). But traveling to the library
                                often added time and costs to research
                                projects. Now, by going to the library’s
                                website, researchers can access digitized
                                versions
                                of Douglass’s papers without physically going

                                pumped-storage hydropower facility (a
                                “water-battery”) located in the United States
                                along the Tennessee River. When energy demand
                                is low, excess power from the regional electric
                                utility’s nuclear plants is used to pump
                                water (from a lower reservoir filled from the
                                Tennessee River) up a shaft to the summit
                                lake, where the water is stored as gravitational
                                potential energy. When energy demand peaks,
                                the water drains down from the summit lake,

                                Burton’s 1885 novel <em>The Squatter and the
                                    Don</em>.</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Don Mariano Alamar was silently walking up and
                                down the front
                                piazza of his house at the rancho; his hands
                                listlessly clasped behind and his head
                                slightly bent forward in deep thought. He had
                                pushed away to one side the many
                                arm-chairs and wicker rockers with which the
                                piazza was furnished. He wanted a long
                                space to walk. That his meditations were far
                                from agreeable, could easily be seen by the
                                compressed lips, slight frown, and sad gaze of
                                his mild and beautiful blue eyes.

                                vocabulary, with one or more substrates, or
                                secondary contributors. English-lexifying
                                creoles in the Caribbean, such as Jamaican
                                Patois, rely on West African substrates, while
                                Hawaiian Pidgin relies on ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i, the
                                Polynesian language of the Native Hawaiian
                                people, with further contributions from
                                Cantonese and other East Asian languages,
                                Portuguese, and Spanish. This is a heterogeneous
                                history, even for a creole language.
                                Moreover, numerous similarities are found among
                                the East Asian substrates, as well as
                                between Portuguese and Spanish. Thus, it can be

                            function comparable to that of adjectives are

                            consonant (as used in “thick”) can be credited to
                            the absence of “th” consonants in ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i,
                            though most other Polynesian languages lack
                            “th” consonants too.</li>

                            many first-language speakers of Hawaiian Pidgin
                            align their pronunciation, word choice, and
                            syntax more closely with English in certain
                            conversational contexts than in others. </li>
                        <li><strong>D.</strong> The usage of the Hawaiian Pidgin
                            verb “ste” to
                            convey a temporary state, as in the statement “da

                            water is cold), most nearly resembles that of the
                            ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i verb <em>noho</em>, though the
                            Portuguese verb <em>ficar</em> and the Spanish verb
                            <em>estar</em>ficar and the Spanish

                            have similar usages and may also exert an influence

                                like the Everglades in Florida. Laura D’Acunto
                                and colleagues wanted to know how these birds
                                choose an area in which to live. They looked at
                                features of the birds’ habitats, such as the
                                geographic location of the area and how deep the
                                water is during the birds’ breeding season.
                                They found that great blue herons prefer areas
                                with deep water during breeding season, but
                                that was not true for small dark herons. The
                                researchers concluded that water management
                                strategies that increase the depth of water in
                                potential wetland bird habitats during

                            <p>Filtration is a widely used method for removing
                                microplastics—plastics with a width less than
                                5 millimeters (mm)—from waterways. However,
                                filtration systems are typically unable to
                                capture very small microplastics. Menake
                                Piyasena and Nelum Perera designed a device that
                                applies sound waves to water as it flows through
                                a metal tube. The sound waves cause
                                microplastics in the water to gather in the
                                middle and along the sides of the tube. The
                                microplastics can then be separated out by
                                channeling polluted and clean water though
                                different outlets. Testing indicated that the
                                system removes even tiny microplastics,
                                including ones as small as 10 microns, or 0.01
                                mm, wide. This result suggests that __________

                                exposed to financial choices that involved
                                potential losses of either relatively minor sums
                                of money, such as 10 Israeli shekels (low-stakes
                                contexts), or more substantial sums, such
                                as 100 Israeli shekels (high-stakes contexts).
                                The researchers concluded that only the
                                latter contexts were associated with loss
                                aversion.</p>

                            <p><em><em>Tracks</em></em> is a 1988 novel by
                                Ojibwe writer Louise Erdrich. It explores how
                                historical events affect families on a
                                reservation in rural North Dakota.
                                <em><em>Tracks</em></em> is typical of Erdrich’s
                                work. Her writing usually focuses on
                                portrayals of everyday life in Ojibwe
                                communities. Yet some of her novels have
                                fantastical
                                plots and take place outside Ojibwe communities.
                                For example,<em> </em>her 2016 novel
                                <em>The Antelope Woman</em> is essentially
                                fantasy fiction, and the otherworldly events in
                                its plot are set in an urban Indigenous
                                community in Minneapolis.

                            <p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s 2015 hip-hop musical
                                <em>Hamilton</em> depicts historical political
                                figure Alexander Hamilton as a self-made man
                                who, through sheer determination, transcends
                                his humble origins to become a key participant
                                in the founding of the United States. This
                                depiction of Hamilton establishes him as a
                                compelling and well-defined protagonist but
                                obscures other facets of the historical person’s
                                views, namely his elitism and mistrust of
                                the democratic politics of some of his
                                contemporaries. In effect, the musical’s
                                portrayal of
                                Hamilton fails to convey the ideological
                                complexity that a more nuanced portrayal might

                                the biomass density and species composition of

                                at Alacranes and 10% of the biomass at Bajos
                                del Norte. Aburto-Oropeza and colleagues

                                and colleagues determined that macroalgae do not

                                <li>Producer Travis Knight: “It’s a process that

                                    forms of animation...do not have. And
                                    because

                                and 2018 shows that, in general, domestic routes
                                (routes within a single country) carried
                                many more passengers than international routes.
                                However, a few international routes were so
                                popular that they carried more travelers than

                                If I judge right, ’tis the duty of an historian
                                to set
                                everything in its own light, and to convey

                                and no other: I mean thus, (for I would be as
                                explicit as I can) that where a story is
                                vouched to him with sufficient authority, he
                                ought to give the world the special
                                testimonial of its proper voucher, or else he is
                                not just to the story: and where it
                                comes without such sufficient authority, he
                                ought to say so; otherwise he is not just to
                                himself.

                            <p>Elisabeth Pötzelsberger and colleagues gathered
                                data on 23 non-native tree species grown in
                                Europe. They analyzed reports from Italy,
                                Denmark, and Lithuania about the number of these
                                species grown by the timber industries in those
                                countries. The researchers concluded that

                                the water of a stream in rural New Mexico.</p>

                                as if <u>testing</u> the water after

                                slid through the water towards us.

                                morning before going to school. Levi is her

                                My brother complains about my lengthy warm-up

                                superior muscles require more intensive
                                preparation for peak performance. The real
                                reason, which he would think is dorky, is that I

                                goals more easily. Such goals include grooming,
                                finding food, and protecting themselves. For a
                                long time, people thought tool use was unique
                                to primates. Octopuses and other animals,
                                though, have busted the myth that tool use
                                requires hands. Inventively, octopuses use two
                                halves of a seashell to provide protection or
                                a place to hide. Palm cockatoos also get
                                creative. They use leaves to pad their beaks

                            <p>Many people use the trademark “Frisbee” to refer
                                generally to flying disc toys rather than
                                specifically to products made by Wham-O, the
                                company that owns the trademark. As many legal
                                experts note, this may pose a problem for
                                Wham-O. In the US, courts can cancel a trademark
                                if they decide that its meaning is no longer
                                specific to the trademark owner’s products. If
                                “Frisbee” were judged to be a generic term, as
                                “escalator” was, other companies would be
                                free to use it to promote similar products,
                                making it harder for Wham-O to stand out from
                                competitors.</p>

                            <p>Commedia dell’arte was a type of theater that
                                emerged in Italy in the 1500s. It became
                                popular throughout Western Europe. In commedia
                                dell’arte, actors didn’t have a script.
                                Instead, they created their dialogue and actions
                                onstage in the moment. Actors in these
                                plays also usually wore stylized masks. In a
                                research paper, a student argues that doing so
                                affected how the actors portrayed their
                                characters.</p>

                            <p>For decades, ornithologists assumed that if they
                                saw a singing house wren—a bird species
                                found in temperate North America—they must be
                                observing a male trying to attract a mate or
                                claim territory. As Peter J.B. Slater and Nigel
                                I. Mann have emphasized, however, a similar
                                assumption can’t be made about birds in the
                                tropics, where females sing as often as males
                                do. Slater and Mann call for more research on
                                this discrepancy between tropical and
                                temperate female birdsong.</p>

                            <p>Recent evidence shows that a female house wren is
                                as capable of song as a male is. In fact,
                                female birdsong is more common among temperate
                                species than currently assumed, claim
                                Evangeline Rose and colleagues. These female
                                songbirds sing less frequently than males do,
                                and in duller tones, making it “easy for
                                researchers to miss the quiet and hidden females
                                and focus on the loud and colorful males,” says

                            <p>A microgenre is a specialized genre consisting of
                                a comparatively small number of
                                stylistically similar artists. The microgenre of
                                electronic music known as hyperpop emerged
                                in the 2010s, with the American duo 100 gecs as
                                an early exponent. Their combination of
                                dense synthesizer arrangements and metallic
                                percussion with vocals electronically shifted in
                                pitch above the natural range of lead vocalist
                                Laura Les exemplifies the hyperpop sound.

                                    XCX has contributed to that sound by

                                I live in a tilted house. A bowling ball on our
                                living room
                                floor would roll past the couch, past the dining
                                table, all the way to the kitchen sink.
                                And if the sink wasn’t there and the wall wasn’t
                                there and the bathroom behind <em>that
                                </em>wasn’t there, the ball would roll all the
                                way to my room at the end of the house.
                                That’s what it’s like being twelve. Everything
                                rolling toward you.

                                    Algernon</em> was the first Broadway show
                                for which
                                Jess Goldstein was credited as a costume
                                designer. Goldstein was among the Broadway
                                costume
                                designers interviewed by Sara Jablon-Roberts and
                                Eulanda A. Sanders for their study of
                                historical accuracy in costume design for shows
                                with a historical setting. They found that
                                even designers who value historical accuracy
                                will often include contemporary design elements
                                that don’t fit with the historical period. In a
                                research paper about theatrical costume
                                design, a student argues that costume designers
                                for modern productions of the musical
                                <em>Our Town</em> (set in the early 1900s)
                                sometimes include such elements unintentionally.

                            seen costumes that borrow from a wide span of
                            periods, resulting in a production with a
                            confusing visual style.”</li>

                            tried to make them as historically authentic as I
                            could, but when I look at them now, they
                            clearly show the influence of early 2000s
                            fashion.”</li>

                            to make historically accurate costumes is
                            that for some periods, we only know about elite
                            fashion and not what ordinary people wore in

                            means using period-appropriate fabrics and
                            sewing patterns whenever possible. But in many cases
                            I simply can’t, such as when a heavy, stiff
                            fabric would be most accurate for a character in
                            <em>Our Town</em> but would greatly limit the

                                and continue to add shell segments throughout
                                their lifetimes. The walls between their
                                shells’ chambers are called septa, and the
                                concentration of the isotope oxygen-18 they
                                contain exactly reflects the isotope’s
                                concentration in the water at the depth at which

                                septa formed. Paleontologist Amane Tajika and

                                nautilid shells; finding that sample F24 had a

                                sample M02 did, the researchers concluded that

                                focus on developing eco-conscious and
                                sustainable buildings, as exemplified by Second

                                by Selgascano. One way to accomplish this goal
                                is through biophilic design, which seeks to
                                augment occupants’ emotional and physical
                                well-being by establishing a coherent

                                among the building, nature, and human biology.
                                Effective biophilic design is smoothly
                                integrated into its surroundings in order to
                                harmonize with nature; architects dedicated to

                            <p>Many studies have found a positive association
                                between levels of dissolved organic carbon and
                                mercury in bodies of fresh water undisturbed by
                                human activity. But Chris S. Eckley and
                                colleagues did not find this correlation in an
                                examination of freshwater bodies disturbed by
                                mining, leading some scientists to hypothesize
                                that the association could be particular to
                                undisturbed waters. However, Heleen A. de Wit
                                and colleagues carried out a study on
                                freshwater bodies disturbed by logging activity
                                that showed similar results to the studies
                                on undisturbed waters, suggesting that

                            <p>For thousands of years, O’odham farmers in the
                                Sonoran desert of the southwestern US and
                                northern Mexico have cultivated organ pipe fruit
                                and beans, sometimes planting these species
                                together so that the organ pipe cacti provide
                                shade for tepary beans. Doing so helps protect
                                tepary beans from the harshest heat and light
                                and thereby helps prevent soil moisture from
                                evaporating.</p>
                            <p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
                            <p>Tepary beans are well adapted to growing in the
                                desert but grow best when shaded. Inspired by
                                O’odham farmers, who often strategically plant
                                tepary beans in the shade of sun-hardy
                                species like organ pipe cacti for protection
                                from the sun and heat, Gary Nabhan and
                                colleagues planted tepary beans in the shade of
                                solar panels in the Sonoran desert and found
                                that the plants grew well, suggesting to Nabhan
                                and colleagues that the panels provide a
                                benefit similar to that provided by organ pipe
                                cacti. </p>

                            <p>Animals use many objects as tools to achieve
                                goals more easily. Such goals include grooming,
                                finding food, and protecting themselves. For a
                                long time, people thought tool use was unique
                                to primates. Sea otters and other animals,
                                though, have busted the myth that tool use is
                                limited to certain primates. Inventively, sea
                                otters use stationary anvil stones to break
                                open mollusk shells. Greater vasa parrots also
                                get creative. They use date pits to grind

                            <p>Mountain summits are often described in terms of
                                their elevation, or height above sea level.
                                But a summit’s elevation may not be as good an
                                indication of how high the mountain appears

                                2001 study of captive bonobos reported more
                                right-handedness than left-handedness, Jane
                                Goodall’s 1963 study of wild chimpanzees did
                                not. According to a meta-analysis of studies of
                                nonhuman primates, captive populations are
                                more likely to be described as right-handed than
                                wild populations are. Statistical analysis
                                indicates a handedness study would need a
                                minimum of 176 individuals to show a
                                representative result; however, the study by
                                Harrison and Nystrom included a total
                                population of 19, and the study by Goodall
                                included a total population of 8. This suggests

                                The <em>Times </em>[a British newspaper],
                                replying to some
                                foreign strictures on the dress, looks, and
                                behaviour of the English abroad, urges that
                                the English ideal is that every one should be
                                free to do and to look just as he likes.
                                But culture indefatigably tries, not to make
                                what each raw person may like, the rule by
                                which he fashions himself; but to draw ever
                                nearer to a sense of what is indeed
                                beautiful, graceful, and becoming, and to get
                                the raw person to like that.

                            <p>Some studies of migrating animals measure how far
                                the animals travel in a year by fitting
                                individuals with GPS tracking collars. Other
                                studies track annual round-trip distance (RTD),
                                which is equal to double the distance separating
                                the two habitats a population migrates
                                between each year. A researcher argues that
                                since GPS records all of an animal’s movements,
                                using the GPS method to track a population would
                                result in significantly higher recorded

                                would. For example, it’s very likely that the

                            <p>The advent of online streaming has led many music
                                listeners to drift away from ownership of
                                music (through downloads or through physical
                                media such as compact discs) and toward the

                                listeners consume. The researchers reasoned that
                                the ownership model of music assigns a cost per

                                20th-century film serials, which consisted of
                                individual episodes of a single long story that
                                were shown weekly in theaters. <em>The
                                    Painted Stallion</em> is a 1937 serial that,
                                over its 12 episodes, kept its audience
                                interested with the suspense and drama that are
                                typical of the western genre. The student,

                                novel <em>In</em> <em>the Name of
                                    Salomé.</em> The
                                narrator and her sister, daughters of a famous
                                poet, are being tutored by Alejandro Román.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Our tutor, Alejandro Román, brought his younger
                                brother,
                                Miguel, to class one
                                day. By now I was
                                eighteen and had learned everything Alejandro
                                had to teach me, so I was glad for a new
                                face. Miguel was
                                an aspiring poet, and he had heard from his
                                brother that the Ureña girls were none other
                                than the
                                daughters of Nicolàs Ureña, and they were smart
                                as clockwork. Miguel was hoping not only
                                to meet us but
                                to make the acquaintance of the poet himself at
                                Mamá’s house.

                                artists known as the Florida Highwaymen,
                                pioneered “fast painting,” which in part
                                involved
                                swift

                                aesthetic. But not all Highwaymen fully embraced
                                this approach; for instance, though Charles

                            <p>In classical Greek and Roman mythology, female
                                characters are typically cast as either
                                villains lacking
                                in psychological depth or passive victims who
                                are marginal to these stories, which usually
                                focus on the
                                exploits of male characters. Recently, a
                                subgenre has emerged in which writers reimagine
                                these stories
                                from the perspectives of their female
                                characters, giving them agency and complex
                                motivations. Purists
                                argue that such efforts represent a
                                distinctively modern tendency to impose our own

                                civilizations, obscuring those civilizations’
                                beliefs. Defenders of the subgenre counter
                                that reimaginings
                                of the myths for new cultural contexts are
                                almost as old as the myths themselves,

                                goldfish’s delicate fins but later winces when
                                imagining a horde of goldfish laying and
                                eating their own
                                eggs—Dillard struggles to reconcile the

                                could find evidence supporting that assumption
                                in a corpus: “life” is the ninth most
                                commonly used noun.

                                group of students noticed a Western sandpiper
                                (<em>Calidris

                                Charadriiformes (shorebirds), slowly move away,
                                make
                                loud noises, and
                                feign an injured wing as the group approached
                                the bird’s ground nest. Researching this
                                behavior, the
                                students learned that this phenomenon is
                                commonly referred to as “broken-wing display”
                                and

                                toward a seemingly vulnerable adult bird. Upon
                                learning of
                                other birds that also exhibit the behavior they
                                had observed, the students hypothesized that
                                the
                                phenomenon is exclusive to shorebirds.</p>

                            <p>In medieval England, singers and minstrels made
                                livings as traveling performers, but the
                                pieces they
                                performed have been a mystery, thought to be
                                lost or never committed to paper at all.
                                Recently, however,
                                James Wade has argued that a manuscript
                                collection compiled in the fifteenth century by
                                Richard Heege
                                contains three pieces likely copied from a
                                repertoire book belonging to a minstrel working
                                in the area
                                around Heege’s home. Wade cites features of the
                                texts indicative of live performance, such
                                as directly
                                appealing to the audience, extensive use of
                                repetition (allowing for easy memorization), and
                                requests for
                                tips (payment) from listeners.</p>

                            each of those pieces occurs in other manuscript

                            <p>Economists have demonstrated that herding—in
                                which individuals converge on the same action by
                                imitating
                                the economic decisions of one or more
                                peers—occurs among investors. Investigating
                                whether
                                herding also
                                occurs among nations in matters of economic
                                policy, Maru Etta-Nkwelle examined changes in
                                the foreign
                                currency reserves of emerging economies in
                                various world regions in the years following the
                                widespread
                                financial crisis of 1997. Etta-Nkwelle posited
                                that herding would manifest in regional peer
                                countries
                                converging on the same foreign currency

                                circumstances. She found that Asian countries
                                showed evidence of herding but African
                                countries did not.

                            countries’ foreign currency reserves, whereas the

                                recently used computer simulations to
                                evaluate the

                                Compared to the control, the experimental
                                simulation predicted a

                            <p>Should the United Kingdom cut taxes? As of 2017,
                                the United Kingdom’s top tax rate (59%) was
                                lower than

                                rates and
                                revenues, the curve can be used to determine
                                whether tax cuts will ultimately increase a
                                country’s tax
                                revenue, according to some __________ 2017 data

                            <p>In a seminal 1979 study, Daniel Kahneman and Amos
                                Tversky presented students and college
                                faculty from
                                Israel, Sweden, and the United States with
                                hypothetical questions involving financial
                                decisions. Finding that
                                participants' responses indicated that losses
                                have a greater psychological impact than
                                equivalent gains do, the
                                researchers formulated the concept of loss
                                aversion, which has since informed research in
                                fields ranging from
                                marketing to political science.</p>

                            <p>Eyal Ert and Ido Erev conducted an experiment in
                                which two groups of Israeli students were
                                exposed to
                                financial choices that involved potential losses
                                of either relatively minor sums of money,
                                such as 10 Israeli
                                shekels (low-stakes contexts), or more
                                substantial sums, such as 100 Israeli shekels
                                (high-stakes contexts).
                                The researchers concluded that only the latter
                                contexts were associated with loss aversion.

                            <p><em>LaRose</em> is a 2016 novel by Ojibwe writer
                                Louise Erdrich. It explores how historical
                                events affect families on a
                                reservation in rural North Dakota.
                                <em>LaRose</em> is typical of Erdrich's work.
                                Her writing
                                usually focuses on
                                portrayals of everyday life in Ojibwe
                                communities. Yet some of her novels have
                                fantastical
                                plots and take
                                place outside Ojibwe communities. For example,
                                her 2021 novel <em>The Sentence</em> is
                                essentially a ghost story, and
                                the otherworldly events in its plot are set in
                                an urban Indigenous community in Minneapolis.

                                subjects, from the changing retail prices for
                                strawberries and grapes to the forecast for
                                yields of apple crops.
                                A student studying agricultural economics is
                                consulting a graph in the document that shows

                                2016 to 2020. The student wishes to determine in
                                which season walnuts reached their lowest
                                price.
                                Consulting the graph, the student finds that
                                this season was the __________.</p>

                                Their results suggest that poor street
                                lighting can deter new or

                                O'Neill's 1920 play <em>Beyond the Horizon</em>.
                                Andrew and Robert
                                Mayo are brothers who grew up on their family's
                                farm.</p>
                            <blockquote>ANDREW: Farming ain't your nature.
                                There's all the difference shown
                                in just the way us two feel about the
                                farm. You—well, you like the home part of it, I
                                expect; but as a place to work and grow
                                things, you hate it.
                                Ain't that right?</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>ROBERT: Yes, I suppose it is. For you
                                it's different. You're a Mayo
                                through and through. You're wedded to
                                the soil. You're as much a product of it as an
                                ear of corn is, or a tree. Father is the
                                same. This farm is his life-

                                prestigious prize for women writers of fiction.
                                Recognizing that women
                                long had to use male pseudonyms for their works
                                to be granted serious consideration (by
                                publishers and
                                readers alike), the campaign restored the
                                authors' given female names in place of such
                                pseudonyms and
                                brought visibility to identities that should not
                                have been hidden.</p>

                            <p>The belief that women historically were barred
                                from publishing under names perceived as
                                female is
                                persistent. That it is also an
                                overgeneralization becomes obvious when
                                considering writers
                                such as Mary
                                Russell Mitford, who published <em>Our

                                in the 1800s, and
                                Marion Adams-Acton, who elected to use the
                                female pseudonym Jeanie Hering for her novels in

                                they typically think of winged dinosaurs, such

                            <p>The following text is from María Amparo Ruiz de
                                Burton's 1885 novel <em>The Squatter and the
                                    Don</em>.</p>
                            <blockquote>Don Mariano Alamar was silently walking
                                up and down the front
                                piazza of his house at the rancho; his hands
                                listlessly clasped behind and his head slightly
                                bent forward in deep thought. He had pushed
                                away to one side
                                the many arm-chairs and wicker rockers with
                                which the piazza was furnished. He wanted a long
                                space to
                                walk. That his meditations were far from
                                agreeable, could easily be seen by the
                                compressed
                                lips, slight frown,
                                and sad gaze of his mild and beautiful blue

                                Cantonese
                                and other
                                East Asian languages, Portuguese, and Spanish.
                                This is a heterogeneous history, even for a
                                creole language.
                                Moreover, numerous similarities are found among
                                the East Asian substrates, as well as
                                between Portuguese
                                and Spanish. Thus, it can be challenging to
                                credit certain words or features of grammar or
                                pronunciation to

                            confirms their origin in ‘Ōlelo Hawaiʻi.</li>

                            speakers of Hawaiian Pidgin align their
                            pronunciation, word choice, and syntax more closely
                            with

                            though the Portuguese

                                long-legged birds that live in wetlands, like
                                the Everglades in
                                Florida. Laura D'Acunto and colleagues wanted to
                                know how these birds choose an area in
                                which to live.
                                They looked at features of the birds' habitats,
                                such as the extent of tree-canopy coverage
                                in the area and how
                                deep the water is during the birds' breeding
                                season. They found that great egrets prefer
                                areas with deep water
                                during breeding season, but that was not true
                                for roseate spoonbills. The researchers
                                concluded that water
                                management strategies that increase the depth of
                                water in potential wetland bird habitats
                                during breeding
                                season are therefore more likely to

                            <p>Filtration is a widely used method for removing
                                microplastics—plastics with a width less than
                                5 millimeters
                                (mm)—from waterways. However, filtration systems
                                are typically unable to capture very small
                                microplastics.
                                Menake Piyasena and Nelum Perera designed a
                                device that applies sound waves to water as it
                                flows through a
                                metal tube. The sound waves cause microplastics
                                in the water to gather in the middle and
                                along the sides of
                                the tube. The microplastics can then be
                                separated out by channeling polluted and clean
                                water
                                through
                                different outlets. Testing indicated that the
                                system removes even tiny microplastics,
                                including ones as small
                                as 10 microns, or 0.01 mm, wide. This result

                            <p>The following text is from Louise Erdrich's 1986
                                novel <em>The Beet Queen</em>. Celestine
                                takes her infant daughter
                                with her to the butcher shop where she makes
                                sausages.</p>
                            <blockquote>Sometimes Celestine turned around and
                                met the direct gaze of her
                                daughter, a look so penetrating that
                                Celestine's breath caught. She dropped the
                                spice, the string, the knife she was using, and
                                took the girl up in
                                her arms, ready for her to speak as if a spell
                                had suddenly lifted.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>When the baby flexed her entire body and
                                struggled to free herself,
                                Celestine put her down. No matter how
                                thorough Celestine's exhaustion, no matter how
                                little sleep she'd had, there was a nerve
                                of
                                excitement
                                running through each hour.</blockquote>

                                mechanical systems have moving parts that rub or
                                slide against
                                one another, creating friction. This friction
                                increases energy consumption and causes wear,
                                which decreases
                                the stability and life span of the system. Using
                                carbon nanotubes and oil, Jun Qu and
                                colleagues at a US

                            <p>Optimal foraging theory (OFT) holds that animals'
                                foraging behaviors reflect cost-benefit
                                trade-offs that vary
                                by species and with dynamic ecological
                                circumstances. One such circumstance is lunar
                                intensity, which W.J.
                                Cresswell and Stephen Harris found to be
                                negatively associated with foraging by European
                                badgers but
                                Simon Kenneth Bearder and colleagues found to be
                                positively associated with foraging by

                                This discrepancy is explicable in terms of OFT:
                                the bushbabies' greater reliance on vision
                                means that higher
                                lunar intensity benefits them more than it
                                benefits the badgers.</p>

                                folk song “This Land Is Your Land" is widely

                            <p>In a study of collective decision-making,
                                participants were asked to estimate the
                                prevalence
                                of their own
                                political views among other participants and
                                then to revise those estimates after consulting
                                another
                                participant. The participants' revised estimates
                                reflected an underweighting of their
                                partners'
                                input, <u>especially when their
                                    political views diverged</u>. The
                                researchers attribute this finding to naïve
                                realism, a
                                cognitive bias in which people's belief in their
                                own objectivity leads them to discount
                                opposing views as
                                evidence of others' fallacious thinking rather
                                than of reasonable alternative conclusions.

                                reproductively separate lineages—can result from

                                mechanism shared by both lineages. Meanwhile,

                                investigated how

                                Blue Hole in the Abaco Islands—can be
                                hundreds of meters
                                deep and are sometimes part of widespread
                                subterranean networks of passageways. In 2021,
                                researchers
                                conducted the first formal study of the Taam Ja'
                                Blue Hole (TJBH), located in a bay of fresh
                                water and salt
                                water on Mexico's coast, and reported a maximum
                                depth of 274 meters. Laura Carrillo and
                                colleagues later
                                reinvestigated the depth of the TJBH,
                                determining that it exceeded 400 meters;
                                additionally,
                                they detected
                                variations in characteristics across water
                                layers. Layers more than 400 meters deep began
                                to
                                show density and

                                Caribbean Sea. Carrillo and colleagues

                            <p>“Woman Hollering Creek” is an English-language
                                short story by Sandra Cisneros. It
                                occasionally includes Spanish words and phrases.
                                The English text surrounding these words
                                and phrases __________ their meaning, so readers
                                who aren’t familiar with Spanish can easily
                                read the story. Ana Castillo takes the same
                                approach in her novel <em>So Far from God</em>.

                                in the 2010s, with American musician Laura Les
                                as an early exponent. Her combination of
                                dense synthesizer arrangements and metallic
                                percussion with vocals electronically shifted in

                                A. Sanders for their study of historical
                                accuracy in costume design for shows with a
                                historical setting. They found that even
                                designers who value historical accuracy will
                                often include contemporary design elements that

                            seen costumes that borrow from a wide span of
                            periods, resulting in a production with a
                            confusing visual style.”</li>

                            to make historically accurate costumes is
                            that for some periods, we only know about elite
                            fashion and not what ordinary people wore in
                            their day-to-day lives.”</li>
                        <li><strong>C.</strong> “In my view, historical accuracy
                            means using period-appropriate fabrics and
                            sewing patterns whenever possible. But in many cases
                            I simply can’t, such as when a heavy, stiff
                            fabric would be most accurate for a character in
                            <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> but would
                            greatly limit the actor’s ability to move.”</li>

                            for a 2003 production of <em>A Midsummer
                                Night’s Dream</em>, I tried to make them as
                            historically authentic as I could, but when I
                            look at them now, they clearly show the influence of
                            early 2000s fashion.”</li>

                            <p>In recent years, architects have heightened their
                                focus on developing eco-conscious and
                                sustainable buildings, as exemplified by Frammed
                                Earth House, a structure conceived by
                                D’WELL. One way to accomplish this goal is
                                through biophilic design, which seeks to augment
                                occupants’ emotional and physical well-being by
                                establishing a coherent relationship among
                                the building, nature, and human biology.
                                Effective biophilic design is smoothly
                                integrated
                                into its surroundings in order to harmonize with
                                nature; architects dedicated to this

                                novel <em>Bless Me, Ultima</em>. The young

                                the water of a stream in rural New Mexico.</p>
                            <blockquote>The golden fish swam by gracefully,
                                cautiously, as if
                                <u>testing</u> the water after a long sleep in
                                his subterranean waters. His powerful tail
                                moved in slow strokes as he slid through the
                                water towards us.

                                of fish. <u>However, Simpson and colleagues’
                                    study relied on a mean sample size of only

                                can increase the potential for biased

                                morning before going to school. Levi is her
                                younger brother.</p>
                            <blockquote>My brother complains about my lengthy
                                warm-up routine whenever he
                                runs with me. I keep telling Levi that my
                                longer, bigger, and therefore vastly superior
                                muscles require more intensive preparation for
                                peak performance. The real reason, which he
                                would think is dorky, is that I recite the
                                correct anatomical name for each muscle as I
                                stretch.</blockquote>

                                goals more easily. Such goals include grooming,
                                finding food, and protecting themselves. For a
                                long time, people thought tool use was unique
                                to primates. Boxer crabs and other animals,
                                though, have busted the myth that tool use is
                                limited to certain primates. Inventively, boxer
                                crabs use stinging anemones to defend

                                experts note, this may pose a problem for
                                Wham-O. In the US, courts can cancel a trademark
                                if they decide that its meaning is no longer
                                specific to the trademark owner’s products. If

                                “thermos” was, other companies would be free
                                to use it to promote similar products, making it
                                harder for Wham-O to stand out from

                                structures. For example, the lower floors of a

                                <em>Mammillaria</em> throughout the Americas,
                                but their survival can be threatened by high
                                precipitation and dense vegetation that blocks
                                sunlight. Researchers have located species from
                                the genus in almost every state in Mexico,
                                with several of them, like <em>M. boolii</em>,
                                restricted to only one state. The fact that
                                this genus has not been observed in eastern and
                                western Coahuila has been attributed to a
                                lack of appropriate habitat, but much of the
                                landscape in this area is notoriously
                                inaccessible, which suggests that

                                    Nothing of the Dog)</em>. The narrator and
                                two friends are taking a boat down the River
                                Thames in England.</p>
                            <blockquote>In a boat, I have always noticed that it
                                is the fixed idea of each
                                member of the crew that he is doing everything.
                                Harris’s notion was, that it was he alone
                                who had been working, and that both George and I
                                had been imposing upon him. George, on the
                                other hand, ridiculed the idea of Harris’s
                                having done anything more than eat and sleep,
                                and
                                had a cast-iron opinion that it was he—George
                                himself—who had done all the labour worth

                            <p>Researcher Ingrid Robeyns argues that to minimize
                                wealth inequality, there should be a
                                legally enforceable upper limit on the wealth
                                one person can hold. Robeyns concedes that
                                some __________ in wealth should be
                                tolerated—for example, some jobs are more
                                stressful than
                                others, and those jobs should therefore earn a
                                higher income than others. But this is not a
                                license for limitless wealth inequality.</p>

                                2023 novel <em>Where There Was Fire</em>.
                                Teresa lives in Barrio Ávila, a neighborhood in
                                a Costa Rican city.</p>
                            <blockquote>Observant clouds gathered over Barrio
                                Ávila. Teresa sat up in her
                                bed, startled by a flashing news report on
                                television. She wasn’t sure when she’d fallen
                                asleep. Four in the morning, maybe. On most
                                nights, sleep came quickly to her. Violently.
                                But last night, Teresa felt as if she had waded
                                into it slowly, almost willingly. <u>As one
                                    does when playful moonlight splashes in the
                                    receding tide and invites you to join

                                kapok trees. Dead leaves and other falling
                                things collect in the trees’ branches and break
                                down into mats of soil. This is called
                                canopy soil because it forms in a tree’s
                                branches (its canopy). Scientist Jessica

                            <p>Sheffield United Football Club won more than half
                                its home matches between 1947 and 2003,
                                helping to distinguish the team as a top British
                                professional soccer club. Additionally,
                                Sheffield United, whose home uniform color is
                                mainly red, was more successful in home
                                matches than was Hull City Association Football
                                Club, whose home uniform color is not red.
                                Research has shown that many people associate
                                the color red with power and dominance. Past
                                experiences with red objects such as stop signs
                                can even cause people to respond to the
                                color red with caution and hesitation. These
                                findings, if applicable in the context of

                                <li>Atoms in a solid state are ordered and
                                    cannot move freely; atoms in a liquid state
                                    are
                                    disordered and can move

                                    forms an unusual dual structure: a solid
                                    lattice
                                    of atoms (the host) surrounds partially
                                    liquid atom chains (the guest).</li>
                                <li>This hybrid state (chain melt) was
                                    previously thought to be a transitional
                                    phase between

                                <li>A 2019 study confirmed that even under
                                    extreme heat, the host structure remained
                                    solid
                                    while the guest structure did not become

                                    were confined to one-dimensional movement by
                                    the host.</li>
                                <li>Chain melt was determined to be a stable,
                                    distinct state.</li>

                            potassium atoms do not become fully liquid under
                            high pressure and heat; instead, they enter chain
                            melt, a transitional phase between solid and
                            liquid states.</li>
                        <li><strong>B.</strong> A chain-melt state involves a

                            surrounding partially liquid chains of potassium
                            atoms.</li>

                            atoms exhibit liquid-like disorder but remain
                            confined by a solid lattice, preventing the free
                            three-dimensional movement of a fully liquid
                            state.</li>
                        <li><strong>D.</strong> Because potassium atoms remain

                                novel <em>Echo</em>. Friedrich often plays
                                music with his father and Elisabeth, his
                                sister.</p>
                            <blockquote>Father and Elisabeth would argue about
                                everything from the choice
                                of songs to the order in which they were played.
                                Friedrich had given up trying to
                                <u>determine</u> whether Elisabeth and Father
                                were opposites in nature or simply alike.
                                Still, those were his happiest memories: the
                                polkas, the folk songs, the spontaneous singing
                                and laughing, even the bickering.

                                often criticized for being predictable.
                                <u>Take, for instance, <em>Cars 3</em> (2017),
                                    which is part of the <em>Cars</em>
                                    franchise.</u> It’s true that this movie
                                resembles earlier <em>Cars</em> movies. But
                                just because a movie has familiar elements
                                doesn’t mean it can’t also be worth watching.
                                Critics generally agree that <em>Cars 3</em>
                                isn’t the most exciting franchise movie, but
                                franchise movies are rarely as stale as some
                                people claim. And some franchise movies, like
                                <em>Logan</em> (2017), are wonderfully original.

                                being thought of as simple, many birds make
                                clever use of tools as well. New Caledonian
                                crows are well known for creating hooks and
                                spears from twigs. Furthermore, striated herons
                                have been observed using breadcrumbs and other
                                lures to attract fish to the water’s surface,
                                making it easier for the herons to catch

                                features with insects too. To study crab
                                evolution specifically, a team led by Joanna
                                Wolfe collected genetic data from 333 crab
                                species. By examining the data along with the
                                fossil record, her team traced evolutionary
                                relationships among extinct and living crab
                                species. The team also reconstructed a timeline
                                for when land-dwelling crabs emerged from their
                                marine habitats, adapting to terrestrial
                                ones. Given their shared origins and anatomical
                                similarities, crustaceans and insects in the
                                deep past likely adapted to changes of habitat
                                in similar ways. Therefore, the team suggests

                            <p>Human taste receptors contain TRMP5 channels,
                                which affect how sweet or bitter, among other
                                flavors, things are. These channels are most
                                active at high temperatures, conferring the
                                greatest effect for food that is consumed hot.
                                Conversely, for foods eaten cold
                                (particularly below 59°F), these channels are
                                less active and confer less flavor; thus,
                                something like ice cream containing large

                                overemphasized in innovation studies,
                                contributing to the idea that technological

                                always brings greater complexity. Research by
                                Nathaniel Erb-Satullo reveals an important
                                exception: gold metallurgy flourished in the
                                Caucasus in the Bronze Age, but a steep drop
                                during that time (circa 1500 BCE) in objects
                                featuring gold repoussé (in which gold sheets
                                are hammered to create protruding designs) and
                                other sophisticated goldsmithing techniques
                                suggests that simpler processes supplanted
                                advanced methods.</p>

                                novel <em>In the Name of Salomé</em>. The
                                narrator and her sister, daughters of a famous
                                poet, are being tutored by Alejandro Román.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>Our tutor, Alejandro Román, brought his
                                younger brother, Miguel, to
                                class one day. By now I was eighteen and had
                                learned everything Alejandro had to teach me,
                                so I was glad for a new face. Miguel was an
                                aspiring poet, and he had heard from his brother
                                that the Ureña girls were none other than the
                                daughters of Nicolás Ureña, and they were
                                smart as clockwork. Miguel was hoping not only
                                to meet us but to make the acquaintance of
                                the poet himself at Mamá’s house.</blockquote>

                                Alfred Hair, an influential figure among the
                                landscape artists known as the Florida
                                Highwaymen, pioneered “fast painting,” which in
                                part
                                involved working across multiple canvasses at
                                once. That many of Hair’s acolytes, including
                                James Gibson, imitated the technique accounts in
                                part for the impressionistic qualities that
                                are now synonymous with the group’s shared
                                aesthetic. But not all Highwaymen fully embraced
                                this approach; for instance, though Lemuel
                                Newton was also prolific, his paintings were
                                executed with greater attention to detail.</p>

                            techniques, Gibson’s works are less derivative of

                                residents of counties like Crawford for

                            <p>In classical Greek and Roman mythology, female
                                characters are typically cast as either
                                villains lacking in psychological depth or
                                passive victims who are marginal to these
                                stories, which usually focus on the exploits of
                                male characters. Recently, a subgenre has
                                emerged in which writers reimagine these stories
                                from the perspectives of their female
                                characters, giving them agency and complex
                                motivations. Purists argue that such efforts
                                represent a distinctively modern tendency to
                                impose our own values on past civilizations,
                                obscuring those civilizations’ beliefs.
                                Defenders of the subgenre counter that
                                reimaginings
                                of the myths for new cultural contexts are
                                almost as old as the myths themselves,

                                countries because high-speed rail can reduce the

                            <p>In 1965, poet and scholar Dudley Randall founded
                                Broadside Press in Detroit, Michigan. With
                                the goal of making the work of Black poets
                                widely available to the public, Randall
                                published
                                and distributed broadsides: individual poems
                                printed on single sheets of paper. <u>Since
                                    these broadsides became associated with the
                                    innovative aesthetics of the Black Arts
                                    Movement (1965–1975)</u>, Randall’s
                                publication format may likewise seem to have
                                been
                                pioneering; but, in fact, broadside poetry had
                                also flourished in seventeenth-century
                                London, where single-sheet popular ballads
                                flooded the marketplace.</p>

                            <p>While observing birds for a biology class, a
                                group of students noticed a black-banded plover
                                (<em>Charadrius thoracicus</em>), a bird of the
                                order Charadriiformes (shorebirds), slowly
                                move away, make loud noises, and feign an
                                injured wing as the group approached the bird’s
                                ground nest. Researching this behavior, the
                                students learned that this phenomenon is
                                commonly referred to as “broken-wing display”
                                and is meant to lure predators away from the
                                nesting site and toward a seemingly vulnerable
                                adult bird. Upon learning of other birds that
                                also exhibit the behavior they had observed, the
                                students hypothesized that the phenomenon
                                is exclusive to shorebirds.</p>

                                livings as traveling performers, but the
                                pieces they performed have been a mystery,

                                that a manuscript collection compiled in the
                                fifteenth century by Richard Heege contains
                                three pieces likely copied from a repertoire

                                around Heege’s home. Wade cites features of
                                the texts indicative of live performance, such
                                as expressing sympathy for the audience,

                                Paribas are two of the many institutions
                                offering training programs in entrepreneurship.
                                But what results do such programs produce?
                                In a study of high school and business school
                                students in the United States, researcher
                                Fiona Wilson and colleagues addressed this
                                question and reported that participants who
                                received entrepreneurial training showed
                                positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship.</p>

                                typically report positive results, a close look

                                these studies reveals widespread methodological
                                shortcomings. This research literature is
                                plagued by unclear hypotheses, insufficient
                                sample sizes, a lack of control groups, and

                            <p>Due to the Chorotega region’s accessibility,
                                various types of forested areas were converted
                                to cattle pasture as rising international meat
                                prices drove a cattle ranching boom in the
                                1960s and 1970s. Juan Pablo Arroyo-Mora and
                                colleagues used historical aerial photography
                                and remote sensing data to track fragmentation
                                metrics across different land use capability
                                classes (categories that indicate possible uses
                                of forest land). One such metric, edge
                                density, can be used to indicate the regularity
                                of forest patch sizes, with decreases in
                                edge density suggesting a trend towards
                                uninterrupted forest patches with more regular
                                shapes. The team found a range of edge density
                                levels, from lows of around 80 meters per
                                hectare or less in the 1960s and 1970s for all
                                classes, to a high in 1986 of approximately

                            <p>Vegetation has two primary mechanisms by which it
                                reduces air pollution: deposition
                                (absorption of pollutants) and, the more
                                effective, dispersion (dilution of pollutants by
                                ventilation). Accordingly, establishment of
                                green space to reduce major air pollutants such
                                as nitrogen dioxide in urban areas receives
                                considerable attention. Research by Zander S.
                                Venter et al. comprised data from air-quality
                                monitoring stations in Belgium, the US state
                                of West Virginia, and thousands of other global

                                recommended that reducing anthropogenic

                            <p>A soil’s microbial community (the microbial taxa
                                present in their relative abundances) is
                                known to affect plants’ cyclical processes.
                                Corrine Walsh and colleagues hypothesized that
                                microbial communities could also affect plants’
                                flavor chemistry, including volatiles and
                                secondary metabolites like glucosinolates.
                                Recognizing that soil’s organic content varies
                                by
                                location in the wild and could influence plants’
                                chemistry, Walsh et al. introduced distinct
                                microbial communities to individually potted
                                mustard plants (<em>Brassica juncea</em>)
                                growing in a controlled environment, then
                                measured the plants’ glucosinolates, like indole
                                and allyl (the most prominent), that create the
                                spicy and bitter flavors in mustard. This

                                    you wish to trade must not only have what

                                    inefficiency is apparent; a great deal of
                                    time is spent merely finding someone with
                                    whom
                                    to trade.”</li>

                                    come to accept one particular good in
                                    exchange for others even if they do not wish
                                    to consume that good...barter economies

                            <blockquote>The moss in the towering water oaks had
                                become enlivened with a
                                verdant sheen of silver and hung like festoons
                                of carnival or like funeral decorations for
                                the mourning of the dead. The pine green was
                                resplendent. The bald cypresses spread
                                themselves along the water courses while the
                                willows wept as they always did.</blockquote>
                            <blockquote>Mr. Bradford was conscious of this

                            <p>In separate studies, Linfa Fang and colleagues
                                and Sanâa Wahbi and colleagues examined
                                whether plants transfer nutrients to one another
                                using a common mycorrhizal network (CMN)—a
                                lattice of fungal strands in the soil. Fang and
                                colleagues excluded all pathways other than
                                the CMN by using barriers to keep the plants’
                                root systems separate while allowing
                                mycorrhizal strands through—an essential step
                                Wahbi and colleagues’ study did not take.</p>
                            <p><strong>Text 2</strong></p>
                            <p>Fang and colleagues took the necessary precaution
                                of separating the plants’ root systems
                                (thereby excluding root-to-root transmission).
                                However, any barrier used must allow the
                                thread-like hyphae of a CMN to pass through, and
                                this permeability would also allow liquids
                                through. Thus, the researchers’ experimental
                                design cannot ensure that any nutrient transfer
                                observed can be attributed to a CMN and not to
                                some other pathway.</p>

                                research into the debt defaults of Philip II
                                (who
                                ruled an empire including Spain and much of
                                Luxembourg from 1556 to 1598) relates to other
                                work on European early modern state finance,
                                including John Brewer’s research on taxation
                                and warfare. But Drelichman and Voth’s unique
                                contribution to the field is their
                                reconstruction of the earliest extant set of
                                annual fiscal records for any sovereign state,
                                demonstrating in turn that Philip’s defaults
                                were caused by short-term cash shortages, not
                                long-term unsustainable debts.</p>

                            <p>Male orangutans typically disperse from the

                                rate of only 0.54% that year. Such a comparison

                            <p>The subscription economy has rapidly expanded to
                                include a wide range of products—from
                                children’s toys to video gaming services—in part
                                because consumers appreciate the
                                convenience of automatic payments. But as a
                                study by Liran Einav and team shows, consumers
                                are typically inattentive to automatic payments
                                and remain subscribed to services long after
                                their value has worn off. The study also found
                                that subscribers were much more likely to
                                discontinue a service when they had to make an
                                active renewal decision (for example, when
                                they need to update payment information to
                                remain subscribed) than at other times. The
                                researchers therefore concluded that a
                                regulation requiring all subscribers to complete
                                payments manually would likely __________.</p>

                                <p>The following text is from Thomas Hardy’s
                                    1874 novel <em>Far from the Madding
                                        Crowd</em>.
                                    In the text, the narrator describes an open
                                    tract of land.</p>
                                <blockquote>The changes of the seasons are less

                                    this kind than amid woodland scenery. Still,
                                    to a close observer, they are just as
                                    perceptible; the difference is that their
                                    media of manifestation are less trite and
                                    familiar than such well-known ones as the
